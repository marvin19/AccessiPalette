# AccessiPalette
AccessiPalette is a React application built with Vite that offers an intuitive way to calculate color contrast ratios based on user input. This tool is designed to help designers and developers create color schemes that are accessible and compliant with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.

## Disclaimer - Work in progress!!
Please note that AccessiPalette is currently a work in progress. While I strive to create a tool that aids in developing accessible color schemes, we cannot guarantee that the application is fully accessible or that the results it delivers will always comply to accessibility standards. The application is under continuous development, and its features and functionalities are subject to change. Users are advised to use their discretion and consider additional checks to ensure color schemes meet the desired accessibility standards. This project is an ongoing effort to contribute to the accessibility community, and feedback or contributions are always welcome.

## Features
